    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I'm a cybersecurity researcher and aspiring Red Teamer with a focus on reverse engineering, malware analysis,
      and shellcode development. I thrive on byte-level puzzles, clean tooling, and creating adversarial labs that
      reflect real-world techniques.
    </p>
    <p>
      This portfolio captures my hands-on exploration of offensive security, where I rebuild and explain
      classic and modern payloads in assembly and C. I believe in operational clarity, reproducibility,
      and bridging the gap between low-level techniques and professional Red Team tradecraft.
