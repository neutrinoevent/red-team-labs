    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>
      I'm an early-career penetration tester and red team trainee with a focus on reverse engineering, shellcode development, and ethical system compromise. I enjoy working close to the metal â€” analyzing raw opcodes, dissecting payloads, and building tools that reveal how attackers think.
    </p>

    <p>
      This site is a curated lab journal and red team portfolio. Here you'll find hands-on writeups where I reconstruct real-world payloads, debug assembly edge cases, and explore offensive techniques from both educational and operational perspectives.
    </p>

    <p>
      My workflow blends practical exploitation with scripting, automation, and system introspection. I aim for clarity, reproducibility, and a deeper understanding of the low-level paths adversaries use â€” all while staying grounded in ethical research and transparent methodology.
