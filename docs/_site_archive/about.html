   <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I'm an early-career cybersecurity practitioner focused on offensive security and adversarial tooling. This site serves as a portfolio of hands-on labs and writeups â€” exploring topics like payload analysis, exploit fundamentals, scripting for red team operations, and more.
</p>
<p>
  My current interests include reverse engineering basics, binary exploitation, and building practical skills in penetration testing. I hold Security+ and CEH certifications, and I'm actively working toward the HTB CPTS while expanding my offensive toolkit through labs and challenges.
</p>
<p>
  I'm using this space to grow my offensive security skills through structured labs and applied learning. I'm especially interested in opportunities where I can contribute to real-world security efforts, expand my technical depth, and collaborate with other hackers, engineers, and researchers.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Certifications:</strong> CompTIA Security+, CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker), HTB CPTS (in progress)
